General Sturm-Liouville equations
---------------------

These two classes are able to solve the one dimensional time
independent Schr√∂dinger equation. The first one (Pyslise)
solves the general case. The second class (PysliseHalf)
implements half range reduction, for this it assumes the
problem is symmetric.
